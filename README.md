# üì∑ PhotoWorld Overview

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è What is it?

PhotoWorld is a photo editor that gives users the ability to upload, edit, and save photos using the file system on their computer through a Graphical User Interface, as well as optional command line control. The application displays the chosen photo in its current state, buttons for each editing option, as well as histograms that present the photo's Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) levels. Examples of possible editing options include flipping, blurring, greyscaling, filtering, and sharpening.

I created this application as a means of exploring the possibilities of Java and Graphical User Interfaces. I wanted to learn more about their capabilities, while creating an application that I could use myself. I feel that current editing applications are overcomplicated and difficult to use, and I aimed to make one that has the basic editing functionality that I use the most. After using PhotoWorld, I prefer it over Photoshop!

## üíª Technologies

This application is developed using Java and the Swing library to integrate data storage and manipulation with the user interface. It follows a Model, View, Controller system and presents itself in a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

TL;DR:

- Java
- Swing Library
- Model, View, Controller (MVC) system
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)

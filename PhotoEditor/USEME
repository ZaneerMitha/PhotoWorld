ASSIGNMENT 6:
- In order to use our program, you must first run the GUI controller through our main method or through the JAR file.
- The interface then pops up on the computer, where the user has the options to edit any photo they choose.
- They must first open a file before they try to edit anything, and any attempt to edit a photo before opening it
  prompts an error pop-up. The error pop-ups are designed to let the user know what they did wrong.
- Any edit made to the image is possible through the buttons on the left side, and each edit also updates the histogram.

  Edits:

  to brighten the image, or a negative number to darken the image. Inputting anything other than a number leads to an
  error message.

  would like to name their newly edited file, they must put in either ".png", ".ppm", ".jpg", or ".bmp" right after
  whatever they named the file (i.e. "hello.png").
- After saving the file, the user may choose to exit out the program, or open another file and repeat the steps.
